 To Do

#Urgent Bug Fix

#Customer facing issues

#Urgent and important

Certified fixed
client-accepted workflow to celebrate a job well done with the people subscribed to the bug.
status-update workflow. Send out comments that haven't been seen via email. Neglected status / follow?
autoclose workflow
Report tech support issue (put in ticket table) - requires screenshot.
Report tech support request (request table?) - new thing does not require screenshot
Report marketing activity

##Blocking
Mobile does not have comments, etc...
Ability to get to the bug I just field with a link immediately after filing it.
"X is viewing with you" sucks on mobile.
Tools don't work on mobile (not displayed)

#Non-blocking
change set owner
Add project
Add user

Permissions per-project and per-resource (for client use).
Fix jump-to-bug (search?)
Who's online - javascript to check status of who is there and report who is there when looking at a bug.
Live "chat" updates - javascript to check the status of unread messages and add them.
Star important things
Search
Permalinks to comments.
Tag people.. Make more intuitive. Perhaps use a "to" box?

#Important, but not urgent
Add a "cc" field so we can purposefully ping a user.

New Worker

Manage Skillsets
New User
Emails need to be logged in the email_log. All emails are sent to users, so later we may have to give non-usable accounts (Role = External (E)?) to those people so we can mail them without them having to register in the system.

#Important, non-blocking

Emojis
